# React Frontend Application

## To Install Packages
`npm install`

## To Run
`npm start`

## Other Notes
- Indentation is done with two spaces.
- `nhsuk-react-components` currently hasn't been updated to work with `nhsuk-frontend` v4 and above yet so unfortunately we need to use the last v3 release of `nhsuk-frontend` for now. Panels are removed in v4 and should be replaced with a newer alternative.
